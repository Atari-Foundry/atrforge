# CI/CD Setup

This document describes the automated CI/CD pipeline for atrforge.

## Overview

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Releases are created locally. The workflow is:

1. **Build & Test** - On every push/PR, build and test on multiple platforms
2. **Auto-Merge** - (Optional) Automatically merge to main after successful build
3. **Release** - Created locally using `make github-release` (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md))

## Workflows

### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

**Actions:**
- Builds on Linux with GCC and Clang
- Verifies all 4 programs build successfully (atrforge, lsatr, convertatr, atrcp)
- Runs test suite (`make test`) if configured
- Verifies executables work

**Status:** Build status is shown on PRs and commits.

### Release Process

**Status:** ⚠️ Releases are created **locally**, not in CI

**Process:**
1. Build all platforms: `make release`
2. Create GitHub release: `make github-release [VERSION=v1.2.3]`

**The `make github-release` command:**
- Builds binaries for Linux (amd64, arm64), Windows (x86_64), and macOS (x86_64, arm64)
- Builds all 4 programs per platform
- Renames files to include version number (e.g., `atrforge-1.2.3-linux-amd64`)
- Generates release notes from CHANGELOG.md
- Creates a GitHub release with all binaries

**Versioning:**
- Auto-detects from git tags, or specify with `VERSION=v1.2.3`
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details

### Auto-Merge Workflow (`auto-merge.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- After successful CI build on `develop` branch

**Actions:**
- Automatically merges branch to `main`

**Note:** This requires proper branch protection settings in GitHub.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are enabled by default. Ensure workflows are in `.github/workflows/`.

### 2. Configure Branch Protection (Optional)

For auto-merge to work:

1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews (optional)
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Include administrators

### 3. Enable Workflow Permissions

1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
2. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - Select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### 4. Test the Pipeline

```bash
# Make a change
git checkout -b test-ci
# ... make changes ...
git commit -am "Test CI"
git push origin test-ci

# Create PR or push to develop to trigger CI
# After successful build, it will auto-merge to main (if configured)
```

## Creating Releases

Releases are created **locally** using the Makefile:

```bash
# Build all platforms
make release

# Create GitHub release (auto-detects version or specify with VERSION=v1.2.3)
make github-release
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker (for macOS builds)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Cross-compilation tools (or Docker for macOS)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed release instructions.

## Release Artifacts

Each release includes versioned binaries for all 4 programs:
- `atrforge-<version>-linux-amd64` - Linux amd64 binary
- `atrforge-<version>-linux-arm64` - Linux arm64 binary
- `atrforge-<version>-windows-x86_64.exe` - Windows binary
- `atrforge-<version>-macos-x86_64` - macOS Intel binary
- `atrforge-<version>-macos-arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon binary
- `lsatr-<version>-linux-amd64` - Linux amd64 binary
- `lsatr-<version>-linux-arm64` - Linux arm64 binary
- `lsatr-<version>-windows-x86_64.exe` - Windows binary
- `lsatr-<version>-macos-x86_64` - macOS Intel binary
- `lsatr-<version>-macos-arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon binary
- `convertatr-<version>-linux-amd64` - Linux amd64 binary
- `convertatr-<version>-linux-arm64` - Linux arm64 binary
- `convertatr-<version>-windows-x86_64.exe` - Windows binary
- `convertatr-<version>-macos-x86_64` - macOS Intel binary
- `convertatr-<version>-macos-arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon binary
- `atrcp-<version>-linux-amd64` - Linux amd64 binary
- `atrcp-<version>-linux-arm64` - Linux arm64 binary
- `atrcp-<version>-windows-x86_64.exe` - Windows binary
- `atrcp-<version>-macos-x86_64` - macOS Intel binary
- `atrcp-<version>-macos-arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon binary

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check Actions tab for error logs
- Verify all dependencies are available
- Check compiler compatibility

### Auto-Merge Not Working

- Verify branch protection is configured
- Check workflow permissions
- Ensure CI workflow completes successfully

### Release Not Created

- Ensure you've built all platforms: `make release`
- Verify GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Check that binaries exist in `release/` directory
- Review Makefile output for errors

## Customization

### Release Workflow

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is disabled. Releases are created locally using `make github-release`. To modify the release process, edit the `github-release` target in the `Makefile`.

### Disable Auto-Merge

Delete or disable `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` if you prefer manual merging.

### Custom Build Matrix

Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to add more platforms or compilers.
